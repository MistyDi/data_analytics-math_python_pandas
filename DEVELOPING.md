# PS Try DataSpell IDE

> *PS I Tried DataSpell IDE for Data Science - really cool and strong IDE with good-old features of JutBrains' PyCharm,
  for example. It was pretty-easy to migrate from Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab to the DataSpell because of the
  familiar interface, tools, short-keys, I have used for while practicing with PyCharm. Try it!*

> *One of the best ways to receive longer educational-license, if you already are not a student, is to try some
  Stepik Courses (like [Golang Programming \[RU\]](https://stepik.org/course/54403/), solve several tasks and get 
  licence-key for all JetBrains pack for a few mounts.* 

> *Don't worry, if license will be close to end - you can receive it again, ..., by solving several tasks again :) 
  So you will have enough time to get to know with this IDE.*
